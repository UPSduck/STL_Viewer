# STL_Viewer

This is a Javascript based web app I developed to visualize and measure the surface area of 3D STL models
using the THREE.js library.
The user may open an STL file of their own, locally, or try it out with the provided sample file. 
try it out [HERE](http://forrestmcbride.com/projects/measurestl)
